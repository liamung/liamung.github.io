	    <p>my name is liam ung<br>
        </br>i am attending the universiy of waterloo for computer engineering<br>
        </br>i attended harbord collegiate institute and givins shaw public school<br>
        </br>a main purpose of this website is to expose my brother to engineering<br>
        </br>although engineering is unlikely in his future, i believe this material will still be beneficial<br>
        </br>i've always loved creating things as a young child<br>
        </br>lego, popsicle sticks, piles of fallen pine needles, couch cushions, i've used them all<br>
        </br>i've grown to also love software and engineering<br>
        </br>the rush of dopamine i experience after successfully building anything is incomparable to anything else<br>
        </br>i've also grown to become very interested in ai/ml<br>
        </br>i like mushrooms and rice<br>
        </br>i used to be addicted to videogames, but now i don't have time and lost interest</p>
